# Definition: git status

The git status command shows how the current status of the project. It tells you which changes have been made to your files, which ones are ready to be staged, and which ones are not being tracked by Git yet.

In JupyterLab IDE, you can see the same information using the Git extension, which shows you the changes in your project through a visual interface.
